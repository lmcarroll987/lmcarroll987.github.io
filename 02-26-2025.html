Your pinky’s still sore, but don’t you stress,  
<br/>It’ll heal with time — your bass will impress!  
<br/>Though the healing’s slow, you’ll soon be back,  
<br/>Rocking those strings with a perfect attack!
<br/>
<br/>P.S.
<br/>I have just discovered that Carl's get-well card had some formatting issues.
<br/>Tell him I am sorry for the oversight.
